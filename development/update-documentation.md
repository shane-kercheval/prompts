**When updating this documentation:**
- Remove outdated information cleanly - don't add "No longer doing X" or "Changed from Y to Z"
- Simply present the current approach as if writing it fresh
- The reader doesn't have context for historical decisions - don't create confusion
- Update sections to reflect current reality, not revision history
- If something changed, just describe the new approach definitively
- No "we decided to change..." or "instead of..." phrasing
- Keep it clean: what ARE we doing, not what we're NOT doing anymore

**Goal:** A reader seeing this documentation for the first time should get a clear picture of the current approach without noise about past iterations.
