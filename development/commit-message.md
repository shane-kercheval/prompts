Please write a commit title and message based on the local changes. Use tools to get the list of changed files and the diffs.

- DO NOT perform the commit, only write the title and message.
- DO NOT include an author or "generated by" lines.
- Be concise but informative. Do not be overly verbose.
- Use bullet points where appropriate for listing multiple changes.
- Do NOT manually wrap lines at 72 characters. Let each bullet point or paragraph flow naturally on a single line.

**Title guidelines:**
- Use imperative mood (e.g., "Add feature" not "Added feature" or "Adds feature")
- Keep under 50 characters if possible
- Do not end with a period
- Capitalize the first word

**Message guidelines:**
- Explain *what* and *why*, not *how* (the diff shows how)
  - Again, do not be overly verbose, but provide enough context for future readers
- Separate title from body with a blank line
